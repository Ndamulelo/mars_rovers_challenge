1. Many rovers will be landed on Mars on a Rectangular Plateau
2. Rover's position is represented by (x,y,a)
=> x - Horizontal positioning
=> y - Vertical position
=> a - Orientation (direction)
3. NB: Plateau is into a grid to simplify navigation
	eg. 0,0,N (x,y,N) [x => 0, y => 0, a => N] rover is at the bottom left corner facing North
4. NASA commands breakdown
	
	a. R => spin_right 90 degrees without moving current spot
	b. L => spin_left 90 degrees without moving current spot
	c. M => move_forward one grid point, maintain same heading(Orientation|Direction)
	d. Square directly North from (x,y) is (x,y+1)

5. Input breakdown
	
	1. First line of the input is upper-right cordinates on the plateau (5,5)
	=> from this information we can conclude that a plateau is 6 blocks top and 6 blocks to the 	side
	2. Each rover has two lines of input
	=> First line gives a rover position
	=> second line gives a rover command of instructions to explore a plateau
	=> Position is made up of two integers and a letter separated by spaces
	
	=> 5,5 - plateau
	
	=> 1 2 N (Position)
	=> LMLMLMLMM (command)
	= 1 3 N
	

	=> 3 3 E (Position)
	=> MMRMMRMRRM (command)
	= 5 1 E
	
#################
=> Class = Rover
# methods
1. spin_left - moves a rover 90 degrees to the left based on a rover's orientation
2. spin_right - moves a rover 90 degrees to the right based on a rover's orientation
3. move_forward - moves one step based on a rover's orientation
4. execute_commands - receives string of commands and make instructed rotations
